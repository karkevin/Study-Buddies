# Study-Buddies

In university/college lecture rooms, it is often difficult to find students to study with as people tend to not speak to each other. The objective of our project, Study With Me! is for students with similar interests and classes to get together in study groups. In doing so, these students will be able to collaborate with others as well as make new friendships. (Think Tinder, but for students).

Getting Started 

Prerequisites/Made with:
-Firebase, API by Google had to be used (online) 
-Microsoft Azure was used for the AI portion of the program (matching students based on interpretation of their survey data)
-HTML, css and js were used to allow user to edit and save their information on the app
-Figma was used to design the graphics (visuals) of the application (the logo, app pages)
